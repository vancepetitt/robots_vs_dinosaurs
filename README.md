# robots_vs_dinosaurs
Robots vs. Dinosaurs project for devCodeCamp
Main objective is to get familiar with and utilize OOP to sucessfully comlete the assignment.

To Play: Follow the prompts and enter numbers. If the game does not call for a prompt and pauses for reading, a user can press 'Enter' key and the next block of text will come through. After a completed turn, press 'Enter' after you view the results of a move from a particular robot/dinosaur. As of 2/6, the game needs the correct inputs to run successfully. There isn't anything built in that forces a user to input an acceptable choice.
